# S.O.L.I.D Principle in Functional Programming

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

    Write small, reusable functions that can be composed to create complex behavior. Ensure modules are cohesive and focused on one thing.

- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

    Achieved through function composition and higher-order functions, allowing new behavior without changing existing code.

- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

    Functions (especially those using generics) should be interchangeable as long as they conform to a common interface or type signature.

- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

    Create focused, cohesive interfaces or modules. Expose only what's necessary for the task.

- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

    Functions are natural abstractions. Depend more on the "shape" or signature of functions rather than specific implementations. This allows for flexible substitution and composition of different functionalities.
